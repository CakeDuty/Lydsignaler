# Lydsignaler
Overview
This project implements an auto wah effect using Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO) modulation in MATLAB. The wah effect, traditionally controlled by a foot pedal, is automated here, enhancing usability in digital music production.

# Features
Automated Wah Effect: Modulates the audio signal amplitude to create a wah effect.
LFO Control: Uses an LFO to automate the modulation.
Audio Normalization: Ensures the output signal remains within acceptable levels.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.

# Usage
Load your desired audio file (e.g., disco-funk.wav).

Adjust the LFO parameters (depth and LFO_frequency) as needed.

Run the provided MATLAB script
